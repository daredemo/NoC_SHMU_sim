# NoC_SHMU_sim
Network on chip (NoC) system health map unit (SHMU) simulator (in python)

(Let's use "sklearn" as the base library for python machine learning (from here on "ML"?))

INITIAL IDEAS FOR SETUP:

1. Actual and/or simulated data from another program (stdin) piped through command line into the ML program.

2. MAGIC!

3. Output data into files, possibly realtime graphics, etc., and info into stdout.
